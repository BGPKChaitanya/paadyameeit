  UNDERSTAND_TITLE: "Understand the Problem Domain",
  UNDERSTAND:
    "Thoroughly understanding the problem before coding is crucial. By conducting research and gathering requirements from stakeholders and users, the focus remains on creating solutions that address real-world challenges, avoiding unnecessary features and delivering impactful software.",
  DESIGN_TITLE: "Design Thoughtfully",
  DESIGN:
    "Thoughtful design is key to great software, addressing both architecture and user experience. A strong architecture ensures scalability and adaptability, while user-focused design makes the software intuitive. Modular design simplifies development and maintenance, and investing in design early avoids later challenges.",
  CODE_TITLE: "Emphasize Code Quality",
  CODE: "High-quality code ensures software is reliable, maintainable, and extendable. Clean, well-documented code and adherence to standards ease collaboration. Test-Driven Development (TDD) and regular code reviews enhance robustness and quality, while continuous integration with automated testing maintains stability as new features are added.",
  DEPLOYMENT_TITLE: "Focus on Deployment and Operations",
  DEPLOYMENT:
    "Building software is just one step; ensuring smooth operation in production is equally crucial. Continuous delivery, automated deployment pipelines, and infrastructure as code ensure consistent and reliable deployments. Monitoring and logging track performance and health, helping teams quickly address issues. Planning for failure with backups and disaster recovery strategies maintains service continuity.",
  USERS_TITLE: "Engage with Stakeholders and Users",
  USERS:
    "Regular engagement with stakeholders and users is key to building software that meets their needs. Keeping stakeholders informed aligns the project with business goals, while user feedback through beta testing and surveys offers insights into real-world usage. This feedback helps refine features and usability. Post-release support and responsiveness enhance software value and user satisfaction.",
